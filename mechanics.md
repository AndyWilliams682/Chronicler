# Incursion Mechanics
## Incursion Generation
Alva generates an incursion when you speak to her. This incursion is fixed after generation, going to a different portal or entering a new map will not reset her selection. In very niche cases, it may be beneficial to "carry" her selection from one zone into another to increase your chances of getting a specific room in following incursions. She will select non-resident architects at random from the current pool of surviving architects. However, she will never select Xipocado, Royal Architect in zones area level < 68 (this prevents Atziri from spawning before maps).

## Room Selection Manipulation
The same incursion room cannot be selected twice within one zone. After you get an incursion for a room you desire, you'll have to wait until the next zone for an opportunity to enter that room again. This means you should skip the rest of the incursions in that map and start a fresh one if you want to increase your chances of getting that room again. Do not speak to Alva in the current zone as she will generate a fixed incursion that you cannot skip in the next zone.

Incursions cannot generate in tier 3 rooms. This generally means it is better to upgrade a given room to lower the variance as you complete incursions.

## Architects
There are 25 different architects that can appear in your temple. When an architect is killed, they will not reappear for the remainder of that temple. Once you have finished all 12 incursions, archiects will all be alive. At most, you will see 23 architects when building a temple. This means 2 per temple won't be seen at all.

The double-corruption rooms are generally always valuable, which is why I've set them as the default valuable rooms in the settings. The main value of temples comes from selling Chronicles with those rooms.
